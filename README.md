# C++ Extended Kalman Filter Project 
Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree Program - Udacity - Extended Kalman Filter Implementation

# Overview
This project consists of implementing an [Extended Kalman Filter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_Kalman_filter) with C++. A simulator provided by Udacity ([can be downloaded here](https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim/releases)) generates noisy RADAR and LIDAR measurements of the position and velocity of an object, and the Extended Kalman Filter[EKF] must fusion those measurements to predict the position of the object. The communication between the simulator and the EKF is done using [WebSocket](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebSocket) using the [uWebSockets](https://github.com/uNetworking/uWebSockets) implementation on the EKF side.
To get this project started, Udacity provides a seed project that could be found (here)(https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Extended-Kalman-Filter-Project).


# Prerequisites

The project has the following dependencies (from Udacity's seed project):

- cmake >= 3.5
- make >= 4.1
- gcc/g++ >= 5.4
- Udacity's simulator.

In order to install the necessary libraries, use the [install-mac.sh](./install-mac.sh).

# Compiling and executing the project

These are the suggested steps:

- Clone the repo and cd to it on a Terminal.
- Create the build directory: `mkdir build`
- `cd build`
- `cmake ..`
- `./ExtendedKF` (to run the EKF implementation code)

---

## Running the Filter

From the build directory, execute `./ExtendedKF`. The output should be:

```
Listening to port 4567
Connected!!!
```

As you can see, the simulator connect to it right away.

The following is an image of the simulator:

The simulator provides two datasets. The difference between them are:

- The direction the car (the object) is moving.
- The order the first measurement is sent to the EKF. On dataset 1, the LIDAR measurement is sent first. On the dataset 2, the RADAR measurement is sent first.

## Accuracy

px, py, vx, vy output coordinates must have an RMSE <= [.11, .11, 0.52, 0.52] when using the file: "obj_pose-laser-radar-synthetic-input.txt".
